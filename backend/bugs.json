        "summary": "Here's a step-by-step technical solution to diagnose and fix a button that isn't working:\n\n1.  **Confirm Button Accessibility & HTML Structure:**\n    *   **Action:** Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12 or right-click -> Inspect). Go to the \"Elements\" tab.\n    *   **Check:**\n        *   Locate your button in the HTML structure.\n        *   Does it have an `id` or `class` that your JavaScript is trying to target?\n        *   Is the button itself or any of its parent elements styled with `display: none;`, `visibility: hidden;`, `pointer-events: none;`, or does it have the `disabled` attribute? These can prevent interaction.\n        *   In the console, try `document.querySelector('#yourButtonId')` or `document.querySelector('.yourButtonClass')`. It should return the HTML element, not `null`.\n\n2.  **Verify JavaScript File Loading and Execution:**\n    *   **Action:**\n        *   In your main JavaScript file, add `console.log(\"JS script loaded and running.\");` at the very top.\n        *   Check the \"Network\" tab in Developer Tools and ensure your JavaScript file is loaded successfully (status 200).\n    *   **Check:**\n        *   Does \"JS script loaded and running.\" appear in the console? If not, your JS file isn't loading or executing.\n        *   Is your `<script>` tag placed correctly (e.g., at the end of the `<body>` or using `defer`/`async` attributes, or wrapped in a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener if in the `<head>`)? JavaScript attempting to select elements before they exist in the DOM will fail silently.\n\n3.  **Confirm Element Selection in JavaScript:**\n    *   **Action:** In your JavaScript code, immediately after the line where you attempt to select the button (e.g., `const submitButton = document.getElementById('mySubmitButton');`), add `console.log('Selected button element:', submitButton);`.\n    *   **Check:**\n        *   When you refresh the page, does the console log the actual HTML button element, or does it log `null`?\n        *   If it logs `null`, your JavaScript selector (e.g., `getElementById`, `querySelector`) does not match any element in your HTML, or it's trying to select it before the element exists (see step 2). Double-check IDs/classes for typos.\n\n4.  **Validate Event Listener Attachment:**\n    *   **Action:** In your JavaScript code, place `console.log('Attempting to attach event listener...');` right before `submitButton.addEventListener('click', myFunction);` and `console.log('Event listener attached.');` right after.\n    *   **Check:**\n        *   Do these `console.log` messages appear? If the \"Attempting...\" appears but the \"Event listener attached.\" does not, there might be an issue with `submitButton` (e.g., it was `null` from step 3).\n        *   **Advanced:** In the Elements tab of DevTools, select your button. In the right-hand panel, go to the \"Event Listeners\" tab. It should list a 'click' event listener attached to your button, pointing to your function.\n\n5.  **Debug the Click Handler Function:**\n    *   **Action:** Inside the function that's supposed to execute when the button is clicked (e.g., `myFunction` in `addEventListener('click', myFunction)`), add `console.log(\"Button clicked! Executing handler...\");` as the very first line.\n    *   **Check:**\n        *   Click the button. Does \"Button clicked! Executing handler...\" appear in the console?\n        *   If it *does* appear, the event listener is working correctly, and the problem lies *within the logic of that function*. Step through your function's code line-by-line using breakpoints in the DevTools \"Sources\" tab to see where it might be exiting early or failing silently.\n        *   If it *does not* appear, then the event listener is not firing, or the handler is not being called \u2013 re-check steps 3 and 4 thoroughly.\n\n6.  **Handle Form Submission Default Behavior (if applicable):**\n    *   **Action:** If your button is inside a `<form>` tag and has `type=\"submit\"` (or no `type` specified, making it default to submit), the browser's default behavior is to submit the form and reload the page. This can prevent your JavaScript from visibly executing or completing.\n    *   **Fix:** In your click handler function, make sure it accepts the `event` object and calls `event.preventDefault();` as the first line.\n        ```javascript\n        submitButton.addEventListener('click', function(event) {\n            event.preventDefault(); // Stop default form submission\n            console.log(\"Form submission prevented, custom logic running!\");\n            // Your custom logic here\n        });\n        ```",
